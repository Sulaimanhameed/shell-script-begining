Script Breakdown

    Shebang Line:

    #!/bin/bash

    This line tells the system that the script should be run using the Bash shell.

    Function Definition:

    kill_zombies() {

    This defines a function named kill_zombies.

    Finding Zombie Processes:

    zombies=$(ps aux | awk '{ print $8 " " $2 }' | grep -w Z | awk '{ print $2 }')

        ps aux: Lists all running processes.
        awk '{ print $8 " " $2 }': Extracts the 8th and 2nd columns from the ps output, which are the process status and PID (Process ID), respectively.
        grep -w Z: Filters the processes to find those with a status of ‘Z’ (zombie).
        awk '{ print $2 }': Extracts the PID of the zombie processes.

    Checking for Zombie Processes:

    if [ -z "$zombies" ]; then
        echo "No zombie processes found"
    else

        if [ -z "$zombies" ]: Checks if the zombies variable is empty.
        echo "No zombie processes found": Prints a message if no zombie processes are found.

    Killing Zombie Processes:

        echo "Killing zombie processes: $zombies"
        kill -9 $zombies
        echo "Zombie processes killed"

        echo "Killing zombie processes: $zombies": Prints the PIDs of the zombie processes that will be killed.
        kill -9 $zombies: Sends the SIGKILL signal to forcefully kill the zombie processes.
        echo "Zombie processes killed": Prints a confirmation message.

    Calling the Function:

    kill_zombies

    This line calls the kill_zombies function to execute the steps defined above.

Summary

This script identifies zombie processes (processes that have completed execution but still have an entry in the process table) and forcefully kills them using their PIDs.
